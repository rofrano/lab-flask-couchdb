This repository is a lab from the *NYU DevOps and Agile Methodologies* graduate course [CSCI-GA.2820-001](https://cs.nyu.edu/courses/spring21/CSCI-GA.2820-001/) on Behavior Driven Development with Flask and Behave

The sample code is using [Flask microframework](http://flask.pocoo.org/) and is intented to test the Python support on [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/) environment which is based on [Cloud Foundry](https://www.cloudfoundry.org). It also uses [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org) as a database for storing JSON objects.

## Introduction

One of my favorite quotes is:

_“If it's worth building, it's worth testing.
If it's not worth testing, why are you wasting your time working on it?”_

As Software Engineers we need to have the discipline to ensure that our code works as expected and continues to do so regardless of any changes, refactoring, or the introduction of new functionality.

This lab introduces Test Driven Development using `PyUnit` and `nose`. It also explores the use of using RSpec syntax with Python through the introduction of `noseOfYeti` and `expects` as plug-ins that make test cases more readable.

It also introduces Behavior Driven Development using `Behave` as a way to define Acceptance Tests that customer can understand and developers can execute!

## Setup

For easy setup, you need to have [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) installed. Then all you have to do is clone this repo and invoke vagrant:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nyu-devops/lab-flask-bdd.git
cd lab-flask-bdd
vagrant up
```

This will bring up the development vertual machine (VM). Next we will `ssh` into the VM and peerform a one time setup task of copoying the `dot-env-example` file to a special file called `.env` which will contain the environment variables foor our 12-factor application:

```sh
vagrant ssh
cd /vagrant
cp dot-env-examplee .env
```

You only bee to do the copy once. This will establish the following environment variables:

```sh
PORT=8080
FLASK_APP=service:app
WAIT_SECONDS=60
CLOUDANT_USERNAME=admin
CLOUDANT_PASSWORD=pass
```

## Manually running the Tests

This repository has both unit tests and integration tests. You can now run `nosetests` and `behave` to run the TDD and BDD tests respectively.

### Test Driven Development (TDD)

This repo also has unit tests that you can run `nose`

```sh
nosetests
```

Nose is configured to automatically include the flags `--with-spec --spec-color` so that red-green-refactor is meaningful. If you are in a command shell that supports colors, passing tests will be green while failing tests will be red.

### Behavior Driven Development (BDD)

These tests require the service to be running becasue unlike the the TDD unit tests that test the code locally, these BDD intagration tests are using Selenium to manipulate a web page on a running server.

Run the tests using `behave`

```sh
honcho start &
behave
```

Note that the `&` runs the server in the background. To stop the server, you must bring it to the foreground and then press `Ctrl+C`

Stop the server with

```sh
fg
<Ctrl+C>
```

Alternately you can run the server in another `shell` by opening another terminal window and using `vagrant ssh` to establish a second connection to the VM. You can also suppress all log output in the current shell with this command:

```bash
honcho start 2>&1 > /dev/null &
```

or you can supress info logging with this command:

```bash
gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0 --log-level=error service:app &
```

This will suppress the normal `INFO` logging

## What's featured in the project?

    * ./service/routes.py -- the main Service using Python Flask
    * ./service/models.py -- the data models for persistence
    * ./service/eroor_handlers.py -- these error handlers send back json
    * ./tests/test_routes.py -- unit test cases for the server
    * ./tests/test_models.py -- unit test cases for the model
    * ./features/pets.feature -- Behave feature file
    * ./features/steps/web_steps.py -- Behave step definitions

## Running these tests using Docker containers

If you want to deploy this example in a Docker container, you can run the tests from the container.

This service requires CouchDB so first start a CouchDB Docker container

```sh
docker run -d --name couchdb -p 5984:5984 -e COUCHDB_USER=admin -e COUCHDB_PASSWORD=pass couchdb
```

**Docker Note:**

CouchDB uses `/opt/couchdb/data` to store its data, and is exposed as a volume
e.g., to use current folder add: `-v $(pwd):/opt/couchdb/data`
You can also use Docker volumes like this: `-v couchdb:/opt/couchdb/data`

Next build this repo as a container

```bash
docker build -t flask-bdd .
```

This will build a Docker image with the name `flask-bdd`

### nosetests

To run `nosetests` just run it in a container while linking it to the `couchdb` container that we have running by adding `--link couchdb` and `CLOUDANT_HOST=couchdb` like this.

```bash
docker run --rm --link couchdb -e CLOUDANT_HOST=couchdb flask-bdd nosetests
```

The `--link couchdb` inserts the IP address of the `counchdb` container into the `/etc/hosts` file and then defining the environment variable `CLOUDANT_HOST=couchdb` tells our `models.py` file to use that as the name of the database server.

### Behave

To run `behave` tests we need an instance of our service running so it takes two `docker` commands, one to run our service and another to run the `behave` tests

```bash
docker run -d --name flask-service --link couchdb -p 8080:8080 -e CLOUDANT_HOST=couchdb flask-bdd
docker run --rm --link flask-service -e BASE_URL="http://flask-service:8080/" flask-bdd behave
```

Notice how we injected the URL of the running service into our container that is running the behave tests using an environment variable `BASE_URL` in keeping with 12-factor pratice "_III. Config:
Store config in the environment_" which recommends the passing of configuraition parameters as environment variables.

## Clean up

When you are finished exploring this lab, you can bring down these services using:

```bash
docker stop flask-bdd
docker stop couchdb
```

...and to remove them with:

```bash
docker rm flask-bdd
docker rm couchdb
```
